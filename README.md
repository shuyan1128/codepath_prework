## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources to help me complete my submission.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[When I was trying to do the guess function. I came up with the outest if-else statement quickly but I had some difficulty in understanding the difference between “Is turn over” and “Is this the last turn”. Because of that, I found it challenging to come up with the code on my own for the rest of two if-else statements. I wasn’t very clear about how to differentiate between users finishing guessing for a specific clue sequence and the program finishing playing all the clue sequences. To help me fully grasp the logic, I peeked at the solution provided and tried to see how it matched with the flow chart one by one. Then I finally understood the logic. I also had some trouble understanding the github tutorials at the beginning. The video tutorial taught us to download a desktop app for github and I tried to download it. However, I could not edit my README file on the desktop app. I was confused about the difference between the desktop app and the online web app, and I was thinking if I could just use the online app to finish the steps required. Then I tried and I found out that I could easily edit the README file using the online app and also finish the remaining tasks such as copying the GIF links as well as merging my Glitch link. When following the tutorials to create the GIF, I am a bit confused. It says at the first line that “Create a gif of your app using LICEcap or Recordit.” but the next line instructs us to either create a GIF using QuickTime or Using Recordit. I was hesitant about which one to choose as I was thinking if LICEcap and QuickTIme are the same thing. It was a very minor challenge, and I overcame it by clicking the three links to glance at which one seems the most efficient to follow. I chose QuickTime and it worked really well.]
